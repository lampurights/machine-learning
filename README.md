This repository contains several data mining projects, including movie recommendation systems and a liver disease prediction project.

Projects:

1. Collaborative Filtering Movie Recommendation System (Collaborative Filtering.ipynb):
   - Description: This project implements a collaborative filtering approach to recommend movies to users based on the preferences of similar users.
   - Technologies: Python, Machine Learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, surprise).
   - Last Updated: December 25, 2024

2. Content-Based Movie Recommendation System (Content-Based-movies.ipynb):
   - Description: This project builds a movie recommendation system based on the content of the movies themselves (e.g., genre, actors, director).
   - Technologies: Python, Machine Learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn).
   - Last Updated: December 25, 2024

3. Liver Disease Prediction Project (project_DATA_MINING.ipynb & README for Liver Disease Prediction Project.txt):
   - Description: This project develops a model to predict the likelihood of liver disease based on various patient attributes.
   - Technologies: Python, Machine Learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn).
   - Last Updated: January 21, 2025

General Information:

- The projects are implemented in Python using various machine learning libraries.
- Each project includes a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing the code and a README file providing a brief overview.
- The README files provide more specific details about each project, including data sources, algorithms used, and evaluation metrics.
